# WAV to MP3
This Node.JS script will watch an "input" folder for WAV files, it will encode them to MP3 and save them to an "output" folder.

This script was written to overcome Ableton Live 9 ridiculous lack of MP3 render support.

# Usage

npm run wav2mp3 -> Processes input folder
npm run watch-wav2mp3 -> Processes input folder, watches for changes and automatically processes changed files.
